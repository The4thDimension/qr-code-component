## My process

The design was fairly easy. There wasn't a need for responsive design since the width of the qr code component on either of the design was same. I just had to center it in the window using flexbox and it worked both ways. There wasn't any hover style or anchor tags in the design. Inside the component, there were two sections supposedly, top and bottom. The top section contained the image and the bottom section contained the header and the paragraph. As was adviced after my previous project that there should be at least one h1 in the design, I went on and made my header as h1. And finally, I just had to add the favicon and the project was ready.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS image properties

### What I learned

I used this opportunity to brush up on my knowledge with flexbox and as it turned out, it saved a lot of my time. I look forward to implementing this more in the future.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to pick up the next project with more hover styles and responsive design. Maybe I'll take one with a bit of interactivity using javascript as well.
